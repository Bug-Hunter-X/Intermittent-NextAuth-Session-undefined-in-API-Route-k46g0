# Intermittent NextAuth Session undefined in API Route

This repository demonstrates a bug where a NextAuth session is sometimes undefined in an API route, even after successful authentication. The issue is intermittent and doesn't occur consistently.

## Bug Description

The API route uses `unstable_getServerSession` from `next-auth` to retrieve the user's session.  In some cases, the session object is correctly populated, while in others, it's undefined, leading to unauthorized access errors. This occurs despite successful login.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Authenticate via NextAuth.
5. Make multiple requests to the API route (`/api/protected`).  Observe that some requests return the protected data, while others return an unauthorized error.

## Potential Causes

* **Race conditions:**  Possible race condition between session retrieval and other parts of the application.
* **Caching issues:**  Inconsistencies related to how Next.js handles caching and session persistence.
* **Asynchronous operations:** Unexpected behavior due to the asynchronous nature of `unstable_getServerSession`.

## Solution

The solution implements stricter error handling and adds more robust logging to assist with debugging and identifying the root cause.
